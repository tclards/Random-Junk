"Legally-Distinct Tonris(Totally not Tetris)"

Tyler Clardy
2022
Programmed in C++ over the course of an afternoon.

=======================================
		Controls
=======================================

Left Arrow  (<) : Move Tontris piece left.
Right Arrow (>) : Move Tontris piece right.
Down Arrow  (v) : Move Tontris piece down.
Z Key	    (z) : Rotate Tontris piece 90Â°.

=======================================
		Game Rules
=======================================
Move your Tontris piece around the playing field while it is forced downward. Attempt to line up your pieces to fit together and create full lines.
Every piece landed will score you small points, and lines formed will award large points. When lines are formed, they are cleared from the board, and points awarded.
You gain greater points for stacking multiple line clears. Think strategically and attempt to clear many lines at once for Big Points!

The longer the game is played, the faster the tick speed rises, meaning the game and pieces play faster. Get as many points as you can before game over!

If your Tontris pieces stack out of bounds of the playing field, or if spawning the next piece is impossible, the game is over.



Thanks for Playing! 
How high can you get YOUR score? Have fun!
